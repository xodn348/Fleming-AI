  "strengths": [
    "Rigorous experimental design with 2\u00d72 factorial approach and 120 total experiments",
    "Comprehensive evaluation across 5 datasets and two probing methods (linear and k-NN)",
    "Appropriate statistical analysis including two-way ANOVA and Cohen's d effect sizes",
    "Clear hypothesis testing with well-defined research question",
    "Proper control of variables (same parameter count, same pre-training)"
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Paper appears incomplete - cuts off mid-sentence in Related Work section",
    "Missing methodology details (hyperparameters, training procedures, evaluation protocols)",
    "No results section presented despite claiming to have results",
    "No discussion of limitations or future work",
    "Missing conclusion section",
    "Incomplete reference list (only 3 citations shown)"
  ],
  "questions": [
    "What specific hyperparameters were used for training DeiT-Small and ResNet-34?",
    "What pre-training method was used (supervised, MoCo v3, other)?",
    "How exactly were linear probing and k-NN evaluation implemented?",
    "What were the actual numerical results across all datasets and conditions?",
    "Why does the paper end abruptly mid-sentence in the Related Work section?"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Complete the missing sections (Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion)",
    "Provide complete hyperparameter details including learning rates, batch sizes, optimizer settings",
    "Include the full results table with all 120 experiments organized by dataset and condition",
    "Add a thorough limitations section discussing dataset biases, architecture choices, and evaluation protocols",
    "Complete the reference list with all cited works properly formatted",
    "Add code and data availability statement for reproducibility"
