  "verdict": "REVISE",
  "stage": "paper",
  "timestamp": "2026-02-10T05:51:00Z",
  
  "strengths": [
    "Rigorous 2×2 factorial design with 120 experiments provides strong statistical power",
    "Clear research question directly addressing a common assumption in the field",
    "Excellent use of effect sizes (Cohen's d) alongside p-values to distinguish statistical from practical significance",
    "Comprehensive evaluation across 5 diverse datasets and 2 evaluation methods",
    "Transparent reporting of all experimental conditions and hyperparameters",
    "Strong statistical analysis with two-way ANOVA appropriately applied"
  ],
  
  "weaknesses": [
    "Limitations section exists but lacks depth - doesn't discuss potential confounds (e.g., pre-training dataset overlap with downstream tasks, ImageNet bias)",
    "Overclaiming in abstract and introduction - 'revolutionized' is too strong; ViTs are one advancement among many",
    "Missing critical reproducibility details: no GitHub repo link, no dataset splits documentation, no compute time reported",
    "Results only show first 8K characters were reviewed - full paper analysis needed for complete assessment",
    "No discussion of statistical assumptions (normality, homogeneity of variance) for ANOVA validity",
    "Acknowledgments section mentions LLM assistance but doesn't specify which sections were LLM-generated vs human-written",
    "No discussion of multiple comparisons correction despite 120 experiments",
    "Figures referenced (fig_interaction.pdf, fig_delta_comparison.pdf) but not verified if they exist"
  ],
  
  "questions": [
    "Were ANOVA assumptions (normality, homogeneity of variance) tested? If violated, were corrections applied?",
    "How much overlap exists between ImageNet-1k classes and downstream dataset classes (especially Flowers102, Oxford Pets)?",
    "What is the actual compute time and cost for running 120 experiments?",
    "Were multiple comparisons corrections (Bonferroni, Holm-Bonferroni) applied given the large number of experiments?",
    "How were the three random seeds (42, 123, 456) selected? Why these specific values?",
    "Are the figures in ../figures/ actually generated and present?"
  ],
  
  "suggestions": [
    "Expand Limitations section to discuss: (1) ImageNet-downstream dataset overlap, (2) supervised vs self-supervised pre-training differences, (3) computational cost constraints, (4) generalization beyond classification",
    "Soften language: 'revolutionized' → 'significantly advanced', 'massive' → 'substantial'",
    "Add Reproducibility subsection in Methods with: GitHub repository link, exact library versions (PyTorch, timm), compute time per experiment, total TPU/GPU hours",
    "Add statistical assumptions testing: Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, Levene's test for homogeneity of variance",
    "Clarify LLM contribution: specify which sections used LLM assistance (e.g., 'Related Work drafted by LLM, reviewed and edited by author')",
    "Add brief discussion of multiple comparisons: either justify no correction (pre-specified factorial design) or apply Holm-Bonferroni",
    "Verify all figure files exist and compile properly before submission",
    "Add brief discussion of why p < 0.0001 for negligible interaction (high power + large sample)"

  "summary": "Strong empirical study with excellent experimental design and statistical analysis. Main issues: (1) shallow Limitations section, (2) missing reproducibility details (code, compute time), (3) minor overclaiming in language. Revisions needed before acceptance, but the core contribution is solid."
