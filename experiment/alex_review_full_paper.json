  "strengths": [
    "Rigorous Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis: The 2x2 factorial design, 120 experiments, meticulous statistical analysis (two-way ANOVA, Cohen's d, assumption checks), and clear distinction between statistical and practical significance are exemplary. This is a model for robust empirical work.",
    "Directly Challenges a Common Narrative: The paper directly addresses and provides strong empirical evidence against the widely held belief that Vision Transformers disproportionately benefit from pre-training compared to CNNs, offering a more nuanced and evidence-based understanding.",
    "Comprehensive and Honest Reporting: The paper is well-structured, provides extensive details on methodology and experimental setup, and includes a thorough and honest discussion of limitations and future work, which significantly enhances its credibility and scientific value."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Reproducibility Blocked by Placeholder URL: Despite providing a URL for code and experimental configurations, the explicit note that it is a 'placeholder URL for reproducibility' means the actual artifact is not available for review. This is a critical flaw that prevents independent verification of the results.",
    "Limited Scope of Pre-training Paradigms: The study exclusively uses ImageNet-1k supervised pre-training. While this provides a controlled comparison, it limits the generalizability of the findings to modern deep learning practices which heavily rely on self-supervised pre-training (e.g., MoCo, DINO, MAE) or larger datasets (e.g., ImageNet-21k, JFT-300M). The 'architecture-agnostic' conclusion might not hold under these alternative pre-training schemes.",
    "Potential Influence of ImageNet-Downstream Overlap: The paper acknowledges that three of the five downstream datasets (Flowers102, Oxford Pets, STL-10) contain object categories present in ImageNet-1k. While this overlap affects both architectures equally within this study, it may inflate transfer performance and could limit the generalizability of the 'architecture-agnostic' claim to truly novel or out-of-distribution domains where such semantic overlap is minimal or absent."
  ],
  "questions": [
    "Could the authors clarify the exact status of the code and data? Is it available in a private repository for reviewers, or will it only be made public upon acceptance? Providing a functional, anonymized link for review would significantly improve the paper's standing.",
    "Given the explicit acknowledgment of ImageNet-downstream overlap, have the authors considered any methods to quantify or mitigate this effect, perhaps by analyzing performance specifically on the non-overlapping datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100) and discussing those results separately?"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Release the full code, including all experimental scripts, trained models (if feasible), and data preprocessing pipelines, to a public repository. Ensure the provided URL is active and functional for review.",
    "Expand the 'Related Work' section to more explicitly discuss how prior comparative studies between CNNs and Transformers might have implicitly conflated the 'from scratch' and 'pre-training benefit' questions, and how this paper specifically disentangles them.",
    "For future work, consider investigating the impact of different data augmentation strategies during fine-tuning. While standard ImageNet statistics are used, architecture-specific augmentation choices (e.g., RandAugment for ViTs) might subtly influence transfer performance and could reveal latent interaction effects."
